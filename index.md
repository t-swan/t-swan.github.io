# Hi All!

I'm t-swan.  After letting my limited (matlab) coding skills age for 15 years, I'm trying to get back in the swing of things in the key of C(++).

Playing with ```markdown```
 - is interesting
 - is certainly easier than html, and
 - is intuitive (when provided with examples).

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
